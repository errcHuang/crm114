I want to say to all of my supporters and all of the voters, you have carried us every step of the way with passion and determination that some critics tried to dismiss. Because of you, this campaign is the only one, Democrat or Republican, to win more than 10 million votes. I’m going forward because more voices remain to be heard, and tomorrow it’s on to Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. We need you to be volunteering. I hope you will join the 1.1 million people who’ve already contributed at HillaryClinton.com—and by the way, most with less than $100—because we have more work to do.
